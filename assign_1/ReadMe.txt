1.	Real time : Is a wall clock time. Times from start to finish of the call including 	time used by other processes and time the process spends blocked.
	User time : Amount of CPU time spent in user-mode within the process
	Sys time  : Amount of CPU time spent in the kernel within the process

2. 	Sys time is longer. I believe that it is longer because the processes are ran and 	executed in the kernel, whose time is listed under sys time.

3. 	The parallel downloader finishes faster. It is faster because many files are being 	downloaded at the same time by different processors, as apposed to serial which is 	only downloading one file at a time.

4. 	Yes, it is still faster.
